The model was trained on a dataset containing information about students' demographics and their academic performance. 
Initially, dataset was collected from DPTEI UNY from 2019 to 2023 academic calendar years. 
It consists of 140 features which include students' demographic and students' all courses in 4 years. 
The following machine learning models were considered: Random Forest, kNN, Decision Tree, SVM, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting, Neural Network, and Stochastic Gradient Descent.
After evaluation, the Random Forest model was selected as the best performing model with 85% Accuracy and 0.88 of ROC AUC.
